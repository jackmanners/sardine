get_event_completion_summary(
  project,
  forms = NULL,
  events = NULL,
  format = c("wide", "long"),
  datatable = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{project}{A redcap_project object}

\item{forms}{Character vector of form names to include. If NULL, includes all forms (default: NULL)}

\item{events}{Character vector of event names to include. If NULL, includes all events (default: NULL)}

\item{format}{Character. Output format: "wide" (default) or "long"}

\examples{
\dontrun{
project <- redcap_project()

# Get completion summary for all events and forms
completion <- get_event_completion_summary(project)

# Specific forms
completion <- get_event_completion_summary(
  project,
  forms = c("demographics", "baseline_survey", "follow_up")
